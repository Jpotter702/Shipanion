# Sprint 3 Summary

This document summarizes the features implemented in Sprint 3 of the Shipanion project.

## Overview

Sprint 3 focused on enhancing the user experience through improved UI feedback, session continuity, and better integration with ElevenLabs. The main goals were to:

1. Implement step tracking and visualization
2. Improve the integration with ElevenLabs
3. Add session continuity features
4. Enhance the overall robustness of the application

## Features Implemented

### Part 1: Step Tracking

#### 1.1 Step Reducer Implementation
- Created a `useStepReducer` hook to track the current step in the shipping process
- Defined shipping steps: ZIP_COLLECTED, WEIGHT_CONFIRMED, QUOTE_READY, LABEL_CREATED
- Added state management for current step, completed steps, and last updated timestamp
- Implemented WebSocket message processing to update the step state

#### 1.2 StepperAccordion Enhancement
- Updated the `StepperAccordion` component to highlight the active step
- Added check icons for completed steps
- Implemented visual enhancements like pulsing effects and ring highlights
- Created a test component to verify the functionality

#### 1.3 Client Tool Result Routing
- Enhanced `useWebSocket.ts` to handle `client_tool_result` messages with `tool_name: get_shipping_quotes`
- Implemented dispatching of quote results to the reducer for `QuoteCard.tsx` to render
- Added proper error handling and logging

#### 1.4 Loading State for Quotes
- Added loading state while waiting for quotes
- Implemented a skeleton UI in `QuoteCard` component
- Set `loading: true` when `client_tool_call` is sent
- Reset loading state when `client_tool_result` arrives

### Part 2: ElevenLabs Integration

#### 2.1 Bob's Response to Quotes
- Implemented full round-trip testing where Bob receives a `client_tool_result` and speaks it aloud
- Created tools to analyze JSON payload for formatting issues
- Added scripts to capture and log WebSocket messages for debugging

#### 2.2 Quote Speaking Verification
- Created a test to confirm Bob speaks quotes aloud
- Implemented a checklist for verifying Bob's response
- Added tools to analyze Bob's response and compare it to expected format
- Created documentation for adjusting the tool prompt in Agent Studio

#### 2.3 Contextual Updates
- Implemented sending a second WebSocket message with `type: contextual_update` after returning a `client_tool_result`
- Added human-readable messages for ElevenLabs
- Ensured structured data is sent to the AccordionStepper UI
- Created tests to verify both ElevenLabs and UI receive contextual updates

### Part 3: Session Continuity

#### 3.1 Session ID in Messages
- Modified JWT decoding logic to extract `session_id`
- Attached session ID to every outbound WebSocket message
- Ensured session continuity across connections

#### 3.2 Reconnect/Resume Logic
- Implemented WebSocket disconnect detection and automatic reconnection
- Added logic to request the last known state using `session_id`
- Restored UI position after reconnection

#### 3.3 ElevenLabs Session Resumption
- Configured ElevenLabs to carry `session_id` in tool call metadata
- Implemented logic for Bob to continue where the previous conversation left off
- Ensured session state is maintained across disconnections

8. **Session Continuity Guide**: `docs/SESSION_CONTINUITY_GUIDE.md`

## Future Improvements

While Sprint 3 implemented many important features, there are still some areas for future improvement:

1. **TLS Implementation**: Add TLS (`wss://`) for production WebSocket URL
2. **Logging Middleware**: Create a `log_message()` function to store all WebSocket messages with timestamps
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement throttling for incoming messages per IP or `user_id`
4. **Error Recovery**: Enhance error handling and recovery mechanisms
5. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize WebSocket message processing for better performance

## Conclusion

Sprint 3 significantly improved the user experience by adding step tracking, enhancing ElevenLabs integration, and implementing session continuity. The application is now more robust, user-friendly, and provides better feedback to users throughout the shipping process.
